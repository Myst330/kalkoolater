# kalkoolater

I do this because codering is nice and uh my brain expands when do so 
Also boredom and I want to do something other than play chrome://dino not sponsored btw or whatever they say

Time to learn how strings work


## How to use or something
So first u download the folder or whatever and then you run kalkoolater.exe and then the thing will lead the way
I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/examples/calculator-switch-case"> this cool website </a> but I don't think that I copied the whole entire thing. At least intentionally. I'm only doing this to learn how to code anyway so idk.
